Note: Full Bondsmiths are generally restricted for player characters, though you may play as a squire or attendant. You are driven by a desire to unite rather than divide. You strive to resolve conflicts and mediate disputes, seeking peace before engaging in war. You are willing to take responsibility for your past actions and failures to become a better leader.<br><br><strong> Playstyle: </strong>You act as the heart and commander of your team. You are less suited for direct combat than other orders (lacking a Shardblade), but you wield unique powers to manipulate spiritual Connections, creating visions or binding allies together.</span></span> → <span class="surge-linkpre">Surges: </span><a href="adhesion.html" class="surge-link">Adhesion, </a><a href="tension.html" class="surge-link">Tension</a> → <span class="order-class">Class: Leader</span><br>
